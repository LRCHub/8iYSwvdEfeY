```lrc
[00:00.08] It's horrible
[00:00.75] One little evening alone home
[00:02.35] End up with carpal tunnel syndrome
[00:04.27] And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches
[00:06.62] Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes
[00:09.21] Supposed to be checking e-mails
[00:10.81] All I got is messages from ass naked females
[00:32.81] 
[00:13.85] I don't know a Jenny
[00:14.97] She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny
[00:18.22] And that's the last time I saw her
[00:19.02] But thousands of more horror and on-line Gomorra
[00:22.13] And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out
[00:23.91] And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts
[00:26.97] I wonder what I owe her for a whole box of caramel coconut Samoa
[00:58.97] 
[00:30.33] ("Nite nite!") Uh, okay honey, sweet dreams
[00:32.93] Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans
[00:34.73] A metal handful, wipe it on the quilt
[00:36.88] Wife wakes up and I'm kill't over spilled milk
[00:39.26] Locked in looking at your picture
[00:41.19] Fully clothed winter and I'm right there with ya
[00:43.54] Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone
[00:45.69] A man could only wish you could do the same till he get home
[01:15.69] 
[00:47.87] Fat chance, at least he get snacks
[00:50.08] That'd have to do till a brother get back
[00:51.98] Untill then smack One-Eyed Jack
[00:53.90] And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack
[00:57.13] That's three different flavors
[00:58.67] Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry wafers
[01:00.76] Acting all hard, 'bout to get beat up
[01:02.96] I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up
[01:05.21] As soon as he fell off his beat down
[01:07.35] All I hear is, "13th cell put the sheet down"
[01:29.85] 
[01:09.82] Damn C.O
[01:10.57] What the hell do she know?
[01:11.61] Besides the fact that she wanna get dug out on the d-low
[01:14.15] A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
[01:16.08] Out in the mountains and I stop drinking again
[01:18.44] In the wee hours, he's gotten farther
[01:20.29] Needing three showers, being hot and bothered
[01:22.55] The wiz with her legs bent pregnant
[01:24.76] God bless the day she wondered where her egg went
[01:27.01] I need a L but it's hard to drink with out it
[01:29.28] And could use some kookies but trying not to think about it
[01:31.17] Watching "BET" on jazz for knowledge on file
[01:33.59] Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild
[01:36.01] Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch
[01:39.10] Like we got for lunch, chocolate fudge butter crunch
[02:05.10] 
[01:49.42] You don't mess with the Ritz Bitz
[01:51.09] Wheat Thins, Saltines or Triscuits
[01:53.87] Matzos or Cheez-Its
[01:55.32] Catch sugar fits every time that he sees
[01:57.94] Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk
[01:59.86] Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
[02:01.90] Even the Oreos, no matter what the weather
[02:04.52] Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together
[02:29.02] 
[02:06.84] In the game he's shameless
[02:08.21] Even uses a code name: Famous Amos
[02:10.74] Cheaper than a short stay at the Days Inn
[02:12.63] And good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin
[02:15.37] Give a hand to who invented the camera
[02:16.92] Skip past the graham, animal and Grandma's
[02:19.44] Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill
[02:21.62] Or get caught with a handful of cream fill
[02:42.62] 
[02:24.34] "Oh, honey!"
[02:25.61] "What are you doing? That's so nasty!" (It might seem ill)
[02:28.44] "Ew! Go wash your hand! No!"
[02:32.48] "Get out of here!" (Kookies)
[02:46.48] 
[03:03.41] DOOM is master of the world
[03:07.49] I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug of yours in my history book
[03:10.08] You've disturbed me for the last time
[03:15.76] Hey, y'know something gang? That DOOM ain't really all bad
[03:20.14] What do you mean, Ben?
[03:21.30] Well, on account of him I had me a real good time
[03:24.34] Y'know? I mean, between you and me, I kinda like being black
[03:27.91] Well, maybe if we're lucky, he'll attack us once more and send you back, Benjamin
[03:33.90] Ah-haha, very funny, very-very funny
[03:46.76] He must be mad
[03:47.83] Well, if anyone can do it, nevertheless let's get out of here, while we can
[03:54.32] Food, we need food
